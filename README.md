# FactorioLike ⚙️

__A project made as an exercise from Objectif3D to learn basic C++.__

The goal was to make a console game where a map was randomly generated with trees and resource nodes.

The player could move on the map, interact with them to get information, craft items, and place machines on certain nodes to get constant resource income.

The game also contains a save/load system, an inventory, pause menu, and a health/food system.
